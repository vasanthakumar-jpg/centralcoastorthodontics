With all the hard work you put in during treatment, we want you to be able to enjoy your new smile for a lifetime and lost or damaged retainers shouldn’t stand in the way of that. That’s why we offer our patients the Retain program, a special service designed to ensure your orthodontic results last."}

   list2 = {"Convenient Deliveries — With the Retain program, you don’t have to worry about scheduling appointments to get new retainers. The program delivers fresh, clean aligners right to your doorstep, ensuring you always have a new set when you need it."}
   list3 = {"Parental Peace Of Mind — For those with children or teens who’ve undergone orthodontic treatment, the Retain program offers an extra layer of assurance. Parents can manage their child’s retainer usage from their phone, helping to ensure that retainers are being worn as advised, even when they’re not around."}
   list4 = {"Flexible Plans — The Retain program offers various subscription plans to choose from, allowing you to select the one that best fits your needs and budget."}

    para1={"With traditional braces, the brackets tend to be mass-produced and require our doctors to place the brackets on each individual tooth, one at a time. This procedure can be quite meticulous and time-consuming for both doctor and patient! However, with LightForce, we use indirect bonding, which means the entire set of brackets is placed on a model of your smile in the exact position Dr. Sudit prescribes. Once the brackets are fitted, they are bonded directly to your teeth, and with this technique, the brackets can often be placed in less than an hour!"}
    para2 = {"Ultimately, LightForce braces offer a custom fit for every patient and are one of the most cutting-edge technologies available in orthodontics. The sophisticated 3D technology allows our team to provide the kind of custom treatment that isn’t available with traditional braces. As mentioned, the brackets are entirely customizable and are designed around each patient’s teeth, which means less discomfort, more effective straightening, and shorter treatment times."}
